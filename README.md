# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a coding hobbyist living in Singapore. On the journey of self-improvement, I stumbled upon programming. Little did I know, it became my newfound hobby. My favourite programming language is Python, due to it's versatility and ease of use. Unsurprisingly, it was also the programming language that got me into coding! I aspire to create software as a way to challenge myself in my programming skills, and also learn something new along the way. Hopefully, the code I create can benefit the society.
